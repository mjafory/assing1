    <h1 align=center>WHO I AM</h1>

    <p>
        The creation of this portfolio provided me with a chance to reflect on my web coding skills in several years. As you browse around, I hope that you are able to gain a strong sense for who I am as a web developer and how I incorporate my project in the classroom. Each section of this portfolio represents a small piece of information that <img src="img/me.png">reflects who I am and what I am capable of.
    </p>


    <p>Well, people say I’m naturally quiet. This is partially true. While I may come out as shy and reserved to people who don’t know me, I’m actually quite talkative. The reality of the matter is I rarely make the first approach to talk to strangers. Therefore, I’m usually a lone wolf in social settings, unless my pack decides to accompany me.</p>

    <p>But, when a person approaches me, I’m very friendly and when the stranger is patient enough s/he may witness my jovial side. Not to be mistaken as a social reject, but my lack of interaction is not a weakness or a deficiency. It is just that I dislike engaging in small talk. I enjoy intelligent conversations and these are rarely found in social settings.</p>


    <p>
        What I dislike the most in life is dishonest people. With dishonest people, you can never know what they are planning for you. Dealing with hypocrites is very difficult, because they trick you into letting your guard down and you become very vulnerable. They will attack when you are down or when you least expect it.</p>
